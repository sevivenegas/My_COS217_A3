What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

I found this assignment to be quite enjoyable and pretty helpful. I 
learned a lot and was able to apply new concepts and technical skills 
from the past few weeks. I also want to highlight that the assignment 
page was very clear and provided good detail answering most questions 
I had.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on symtablelist.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on symtablelist.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

symtablelist.c: line 65: medium priority:
Do you want to validate 'pvValue' through an assert?

symtablelist.c: line 113: medium priority:
Do you want to validate 'pvValue' through an assert?

symtablelist.c: line 212: medium priority:
Do you want to validate 'pvExtra' through an assert?

These warning are all for the same reason; however they priortize style
over functionality as NULL is a valid value for them demonstrated by 
the test cases. Adding assert would cause unneseccary errors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on symtablehash.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on symtablehash.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are the CPU times reported by testsymtable.c with binding counts
50, 500, 5000, 50000, and 500000 using (1) your linked list
implementation, (2) your non-expanding hash table implementation, and
(3) your expanding hash table implementation? Fill in the blanks.

The linked list implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed 0 seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed 0.006711 seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed 1.105507 seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed 110.740907 seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed (over 5 min) seconds.

The non-expanding hash table implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed 0 seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed 0.001542 seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed 0.007013 seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed 0.439897 seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed 88.806682 seconds.

The expanding hash table implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed ________ seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed ________ seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed ________ seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed ________ seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed ________ seconds.
